# Utilities

A collection of utilities I have personally found helpful in my development
career.

## How to Install

The simplest way to install one or multiple of these utilities is to run

```sh
$ bash <(curl -s 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/M3L6H/utilities/master/download.sh')
```

You will be provided with a guided prompt that will walk you through the
process of installing the utilities in this repository.
